## Objectif: 
Compare differents Python libraries to validate YAML Schema (structure of the file)


### Schema


### Pydantic
Data validation library, where validation means: instantiate a model that adhere to specified types and constraint, not only verify that the data
correspond to specified schema.

Have a pydantic-yaml plugin to hand Yaml that is based on ruamel.yamel. But it don't specify personal yaml loader to parse yaml file, 
only to dump to yaml. So not really adapted for the project.
Could still be useful to generate yaml. lg

### Yamale



### Yatiml


### Cerberus
