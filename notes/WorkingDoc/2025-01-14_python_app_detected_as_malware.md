# python_app_detected_as_malware 

Application built with Python tend to be recognize by antivirus software by malware due to the fact that hacker and pirate use to use 
Python to create malware.

This is a common issue with app built with PyInstaller. The type of build can happen the propotion of the app to be tagged as a malware.
App build as onefile haw more chance to be identify as a malware because it needs to unpacked certains data every time it's launche unlike onedire build.

Nuitka could be an alternative, since it's translate python code to C before compiling it. This way, antivirus might not detect and Python code so be less inclined
to consider the app as a malware. Again, onefile builds tends to activate firewall message as it creates a new temp file at every launch. This can be avoided by caching the temp dir.
But it's still possible that the app is considered as a malware. Nuitka can proposer solution but only with commercial version(paying)
