# pyvisa 

PyVISA is a python package that enable to control measurement devices independently of the interface.
The Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) is a standard for configuring, programming 
and troubleshooting instrumentation systems comprising GPIB, VXI, PXI, Serial, Ethernet and/or
USB interfaces.
PyVISA is both a wrapper for VISA shared libraries but also a front-end for other VISA implementation.


## Backend
In order to work, PyVISA need to have a suitable backend. It includes a backend that wraps the National
Instrument's VISA library but you need to download and install the library yourself.
You can alternatively instal PyVISA-py which is a pure Python implementation of VISA standard.

If no backend is specified, PyVISA uses the IVI backend if any library is installed. If it failed, 
it uses the PyVISA-py backend.
One can also select a desired backend by passing a parameter to the ResourceManager
```>>> pyvisa.ResourceManager("@py")```
Or by setting the PYVISA_LIBRARY environment variable.
It takes either the path to the chosen library, or "@py" for PyVISA-py backend.

## Communicate with an instrument

***Open a connection with an instrument***
```
resource_manager = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
my_instrument = resource_manager.open_resource(<instrument_name>)
```

To get a list of available instrument, use ```resource_manager.list_resources()```

**open_resource**
