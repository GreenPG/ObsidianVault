# pyvisa 

PyVISA is a python package that enable to control measurement devices independently of the interface.
The Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) is a standard for configuring, programming 
and troubleshooting instrumentation systems comprising GPIB, VXI, PXI, Serial, Ethernet and/or
USB interfaces.
PyVISA is both a wrapper for VISA shared libraries but also a front-end for other VISA implementation.


## Backend
In order to work, PyVISA need to have a suitable backend. It includes a backend that wraps the National
Instrument's VISA library but you need to download and install the library yourself.
You can alternatively instal PyVISA-py which is a pure Python implementation of VISA standard.

If no backend is specified, PyVISA uses the IVI backend if any library is installed. If it failed, 
it uses the PyVISA-py backend.
One can also select a desired backend by passing a parameter to the ResourceManager
```>>> pyvisa.ResourceManager("@py")```
Or by setting the PYVISA_LIBRARY environment variable.
It takes either the path to the chosen library, or "@py" for PyVISA-py backend.

## Communicate with an instrument

**Open a connection with an instrument**
```
resource_manager = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
my_instrument = resource_manager.open_resource(<instrument_name>)
```

To get a list of available instrument, use ```resource_manager.list_resources()```

*open_resource* return an instance of a *Resource* subclass corresponding to the targetted instrument.
It is an interface to communicate with the instrument.

You can then communicate with instrument with *write()*, *read()* or *query()* which is a combination
of the two previous one.

**Configure the instrument**
You might need to configure the instrument so that it understands the messages.
For message based instruments, it usually consists of set the *read_termination* and *write_termination*
attribute of the resource.
Those can be set by directly modifying the *Resource* attribute:
```
instrument.read_termination = "\n"
instrument.write_termination = "\n"
```
The correct values should be in the instrument manual. If not, try to iterate through standard values
(\n, \r, \0)

For serial communication, you need to configure the correct baud rate. Default value is 9600.
Check instrument manual for correct value.
```instrument.baud_rate = 57600```
