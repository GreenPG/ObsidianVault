# Python_pass_by_reference 

## Pass by Reference vs Pass by value

Pass by reference means that the argument you're providing to a function is a reference to a variable that already existe in memory,
rather than an independent copy of its value. 
This way, all operations performed on this reference will directly be applied to wich it refers.

In opposite, when passing by value, you only pass an independent copy of the original values of the variable to the function.
