# SFTP 

SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a secure network protocol that enables file
transfer between computers over an enrypted connection. It's a more secure alternative
to standard FTP protocol.
SFTP uses SSH encryption to protect data during transmission, making it difficult for
unauthorized users to access sensitive information. It provides file access, transfer,
and management functions.

It runs by default on port 22 and requires anthentication through passwords or SSH
keys.

## Key capabilities of STTP
- **Secure remote file access**: brows, view, edit, delete and rename files on the
remote system
- **Uploading and downloading**: transfer files of any size to and from the server
- **Directory management**: create, delete and move folders on the remote filesystem
- **Permissions management**: set read/write/execute permissions on remote files and
directories
- **Resume capability**: pause and resume file transfers in case of interruptions
- **Tunneling support**: tunnel SFTP through SSH connectionns for proxying

## How it works

SFTP layers if file access and transfer functionnality on top of an SSH connection.
It allows to encrypt all communication using SSH tunnel symmetric encryption. It also
benefits from SSH's authentication metho
