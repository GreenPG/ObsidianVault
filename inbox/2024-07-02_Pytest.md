# Pytest 

Pytest is python framework to deploy tests for Python project.

The advantages of pytest in comparaison with other testing framework like unittest are :
 - less boilerplate code
 - a nicer output
 - less to learn, with the use of `assert`
 - easier to manage state and dependencies
 - eay to filter tests
 - allow test parametrization
 - has a plugin-based architecture


 ## Fixtures : managing state and dependencies

 Fixtures are a way of providing data, test doubles or state setup to tests.
 It can be used when you have to reuse some code to initialize your tests multpiple times. You can this repeated code in a function
 decorated with @pytest.fixture to indicate that it is a pytest fixture.
 ```
 @pytest_fixture
 def example_fixture():
    fixture contente
    ...
 ```

To use the fixture by adding as an argument of your tests. You don't have to call the fixture function. The name of the fixture will act as it return value.
```
def test_with_fixture(example_fixture):
    assert f(example_fixture) == expected_result


def test_2(example_fixture):
    assert g(example_fixture) == expected_result
```
