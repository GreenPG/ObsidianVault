# Asyncio 

Asyncio is a Python library to write concurrent code, but is neither threading or multiprocessing nor built on top of these.
It's a single process, single threaded design using cooperative multitasking. 
Asynchronous routines are able to pause while waiting on their ultimate result and let other routines run in the meatime.
Asynchronous code facilitates concurrent execution through the above mecanism.

## async/await Syntax

Coroutines the heart of async IO routines. A coroutine is a specialized version of a Python generator. 
It's a function that can suspend its execution before reaching return, ant indirectly pass control to another coroutine for some time.

```async def```  introduce a native coroutine or an asynchrous generator.
```await ``` pass function control back to the event loop (i.e. suspend the execution of the surrounding coroutine). 

- A function introduced by ```async def``` is a coroutine. 
- Using ```await``` and/or ```return``` create a coroutine function, which you must await its return when you call it.
- Using ```yield``` in an ```async def``` block is less common. It creates an asynchrous generator which you iterate over
with ```async for```. But you can't use ```yield from```.
