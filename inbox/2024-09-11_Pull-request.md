# Pull request 

A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch to into another. Collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.
After initializing a pull request, you'll see (on GitHub) a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository base's branch.
You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and @mention individual contributor or teams.
Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing request. They will appear in chronological order within the pull request and changes will be visible in "Files changed"

Other contributors can review proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion and even add commits.

## Draft pull requests
When you create a pull request, you can create a pull request that is ready for review or a draft pull request. Draft pull requests can't be merged, and code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests.
You can a draft PR as ready for review when you're ready to get feedback. It's possible to convert a PR to draft at any time.
