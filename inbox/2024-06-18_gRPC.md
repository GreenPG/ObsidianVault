# gRPC 

Open source Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Used to build microservices architecture with services using different languages. Made by Google.
RPC : network protocol enabling to make prodecure calls to a distance machine through a application server used in client-server model.

gRPC is based on the idea of defining a service with its methods. The server will implements this interface and run a gRPC server to handle client calls.
On client side, it has a stub (a controllable replacement for an existing dependency, a fake implementation) that provides the same method as the server.

gRPC server-client architecture

By default, gRPC uses [[2024-06-18_Protocol-Buffers|Protocol Buffers]] as an Interface Definition Language to describing the
service interface and the structure of the payload message. gRPC uses protoc with a special
gRPC plugin to generate code for gRPC client and server. It is recommended to use proto3 with
gRPC.

gRPC is based the idea of defining a service and specifying its methods. gRPC let defines 4 kind of service method:
- Unary RPC. Client send a single request and server give a single response back
```
rpc SayHello(HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);

```
- Server Streaming RPC. Client sends a single request and gets a stream to read a sequence of message back.
```
rpc LotsOfReplies(HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloResponse);

```
- Client Streaming RPC. Client write a sequence of messages and send them to the server by a stream.
```
rpc LotsOfGreetings(stream HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);

```
- Biderction streaming RPC. Both client and server sends sequences of messages through independant stream.
```
rpc BidiHello(stream HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloResponse);

```
