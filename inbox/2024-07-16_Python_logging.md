| Display console output for ordinary usage  | print() |
| Report events occuring during operation of a program <br> (status monitoring or fault investigation) | info() or debug()Â |
| Issue a warning regarding a particular runtime event | warnings.warn() in library code if the issue <br> is avoidable and the clien application should be modifiable.<br><br> A logger's warning() if the application can't do nothing about the situation|
| Report an error regarding a particular runtime event | Raise an exception |
| Report suppression of an error without raising an exception | A logger's error(), exception() or critical() method appropriate to the specific error and application domain |

The logger methods are named after the level of severity  of the events they are used to track:

| Level | When it's used  |
