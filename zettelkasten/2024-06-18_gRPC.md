# gRPC 

Open source Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Used to build microservices architecture with services using different languages. Made by Google.
RPC : network protocol enabling to make prodecure calls to a distance machine through a application server used in client-server model.

gRPC is based on the idea of defining a service with its methods. The server will implements this interface and run a gRPC server to handle client calls.
On client side, it has a stub (a controllable replacement for an existing dependency, a fake implementation) that provides the same method as the server.

gRPC server-client architecture

By default, gRPC uses [[2024-06-18_Protocol-Buffers|Protocol Buffers]] as an Interface Definition Language to describing the
service interface and the structure of the payload message. gRPC uses protoc with a special
gRPC plugin to generate code for gRPC client and server. It is recommended to use proto3 with
gRPC.

gRPC is based the idea of defining a service and specifying its methods. gRPC let defines 4 kind of service method:
- Unary RPC. Client send a single request and server give a single response back
```
rpc SayHello(HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);

```
- Server Streaming RPC. Client sends a single request and gets a stream to read a sequence of message back.
```
rpc LotsOfReplies(HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloResponse);

```
- Client Streaming RPC. Client write a sequence of messages and send them to the server by a stream.
```
rpc LotsOfGreetings(stream HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);

```
- Bidirection streaming RPC. Both client and server sends sequences of messages through independant stream.
```
rpc BidiHello(stream HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloResponse);
 
```

As said earlier, gRPC is based on Protocol Buffers and provide a plugin that generate code for the server and the client.
Your .proto file has to define your ```services``` and their methods typed as ```rcp```. A rpc methods take a message as args and returns a message.
Example of gRPC .proto file:

```
syntax = 'proto3';

package routeguide;

service RouteGuide {
  rpc GetFeature(Point) returns (Feature) {}

  rpc ListFeatures(Rectangle) returns (stream Feature) {}

  rpc RecordRoute(stream Point) returns (RouteSummary) {}

  rpc RouteChat(stream RouteNote) returns (stream RouteNote) {}
}

message Point {
  int32 latitude = 1;
  int32 longitude = 2;
}

message Rectangle {
  Point lo = 1;
  Point hi = 2;
}

message Feature {
  string name = 1;

  Point location = 2;
}

message RouteNote {
  Point location = 1;
  string message = 2;
}

message RouteSummary {
  int32 point_count = 1;
  int32 feature_count = 2;
  int32 distance = 3;
  int32 elapsed_time = 4;
}
```

To generate your code from the .proto file you have to call the Protocol Buffers compilers with additional plugins furnished by gRPC, not the original.
Example for Python:
```
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ./route_guide.proto
```

That way, protoc generate pb2_grpc file in addition to the standard. This one contains code for the service and methods defines in the .proto file,
and a Stub class to implement by the client and a Servicer class to implement by the server.


To init a server, you have to create an instance of grpc.server, call the pb2_grpc.add method generated to implement the service. Then add
a port to server and start it.
To init a client, you have to create a grpc channel at the address of the server, and create an instance of the Stub class generated. You can
then call service methods to communicate with the server. 

You can create you can use ALST as an encrypted transport protocol and authentication using secured channels.
